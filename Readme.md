# 🧠 Digit Recognizer App – Powered by Deep Learning

A smart and accurate handwritten digit classification app built using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset. The model learns to recognize digits (0–9) and predict them with high confidence — just like a mini human brain 🧠.

> 🚀 Accuracy: **97.6%**  
> 🎯 Dataset: **MNIST (60,000 images)**  
> ⚙️ Framework: **TensorFlow + NumPy + Matplotlib**  
> 🧠 Model Type: **Fully Connected Neural Network**
